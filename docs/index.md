## Summary

_Buffy_ is a convenient motion picture title finder for audiences looking for viewing suggestions that match specific preferences, and for those who need help remembering the title of a film.

## Intended users

* Consumers who want to watch a movie with certain specific elements, and would like some title suggestions.

    > As a parent of five, who works full time, I don't have the time to keep up with what new movies have been released, and I know I've missed a lot that would interest me.  And I also don't have the time to read descriptions of random movies hoping to find something I like.  I need a way to filter enough specific preferences to return a small, targeted list of titles from which to choose.
	
* Consumers who want immediate assistance finding a specific film title.
	
	> As a movie buff it is very important to me to not forget the name of a film.  The other night I was out with friends and an old film came up in conversation, that we all remembered obscure details about, but couldn't quite place the title.  If I had an app that could find the title based on a few details it would have come in handy that night.

## Functionality

* The user will be presented with 12 different search fields (genre, year(range), actor, director, writer, composer, studio, run time(range), language, MPAA rating, awards(yes/no), and title), into which they can type as much information as they want or know.  The app will return a list of movie titles that match search criteria, sorted in reverse chronological order.

* The user will be able to add a film title to a watchlist for revisiting at another time.

* A "surprise me" button that will only return one movie title, at random.

## Persistent data

* Watchlisted titles.

* Recent search histories.
    
## Device/external services

* [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

* Additional sorting options (alphabetical, popularity, public ratings, run time, genre)

* Links to online streaming options

* Connection to app developer database of film ratings, so in addition to a "suprise me" button, there will be a "Buffy suggests" button.
